# matricemaker

This resource is a step a long the path to improve speed and accuracy in data processing in the Cadre Harmonise.  This script can produce a formatted excel version of the famous matrice intermediare given:
- a household survey data file (usually SPSS format) using standardized variable names (https://wfp-vam.github.io/RBD_FS_CH_guide_FR/)  
- variable names and categorization of contributing factors 

## Notes

- much more testing and work needed to make this  solid but  flexible enough - the hope is to turn a lot of things into functions and then later a package
- currently only works for french version of the matrice intermediare
